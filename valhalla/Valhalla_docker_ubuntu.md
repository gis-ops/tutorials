# How to setup and run Valhalla on Ubuntu 20.04 with Docker

Learn how to painlessly run a Valhalla instance with Docker using our Docker image:

https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/gisops/valhalla

## Introduction

[Valhalla](https://github.com/valhalla) is a high-performance open source routing software (MIT license) written in C++ and mainly designed to consume OpenStreetMap data. The core engineers work for [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and one of the most prestigious companies using Valhalla is [Tesla](https://tesla.com) as their in-car navigation system.

For a comprehensive feature list and a more general overview of FOSS routing engines, read our [article](https://gis-ops.com/open-source-routing-engines-and-algorithms-an-overview/).

### Recommended

-   A basic understanding of Ubuntu
-   Knowledge of running commands in the Ubuntu terminal
-   A running Ubuntu 20.04 with the latest `docker` and `docker-compose` version.
-   The awareness that a red printed terminal line doesn't necessarily mean, it's an error ;)...

This tutorial will guide you through the process of how to configure and run Valhalla inside of Docker on an Ubuntu OS. You can follow this tutorial (please read our `Disclaimer`) analogous on any Linux distribution with a running docker environment.  

So let's go, `open your terminal!`

## 1. Preparations

### Test your docker installation

Test whether you need to run `docker` commands as `sudo` or not by typing:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

If the output is similar to this:

```bash
command not found: ...
```

You should **install docker first**. For a good tutorial have a look at the [How To Install and Use Docker on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04). To install `docker-compose` have a look at [How To Install and Use Docker on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-18-04).

In case `docker` is complaining about not being able to "Connect to the Docker daemon", you can add your user to the docker user group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
# log in and out of the terminal to apply
```

### Create a temporary folder

First you should create a temporary folder in your home folder to clone the needed docker files to:
```bash
mkdir ~/gisops_docker && cd $_
```   
-   `mkdir` is the command to create a new folder
-   `mkdir ~/gisops_docker` creates our workdir folder in your home folder `~/`.
-   `cd $_` changes the terminal path directly to the newly created folder. `$_` is a system variable and holds the (last) argument of the last command line call. In this case the path to the newly created folder.   

### Create the `docker-compose.yml`

In order to run Valhalla you need to create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your current directory and pass the following content:
```bash
version: '3.0'
services:
  valhalla:
    image: ghcr.io/gis-ops/docker-valhalla/valhalla:latest
    ports:
      - "8002:8002"
    volumes:
      - ./custom_files/:/custom_files
    environment:
      # The tile_file must be located in the `custom_files` folder.
      # The tile_file has priority and is used when valid.
      # If the tile_file doesn't exist, the url is used instead.
      # Don't blank out tile_url when you use tile_file and vice versa.
      - tile_urls=https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/andorra-latest.osm.pbf https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/albania-latest.osm.pbf
      # Get correct bounding box from e.g. https://boundingbox.klokantech.com/
      - min_x=18 # -> Albania | -180 -> World
      - min_y=38 # -> Albania | -90  -> World
      - max_x=22 # -> Albania |  180 -> World
      - max_y=43 # -> Albania |  90  -> World
      - use_tiles_ignore_pbf=True
      - force_rebuild=False
      - force_rebuild_elevation=False
      - build_elevation=True
      - build_admins=True
      - build_time_zones=True
```
-   `volumes` is mounting a local folder called `custom_files` into the docker container. This is the place where the Valhalla container shares its data and also the place where changes to the running instance can be made.
-   `tile_urls` will be downloaded by Valhalla and build if their file hashes don't match with the existing build tiles. It's possible to add as many urls as desired with a space delimiter.
-   `min_*/max_*` defines the bounding box so Valhalla can download the correct elevation tiles. This is only required if `build_elevation` is set to `True`.
-   `use_tiles_ignore_pbf` will let Valhalla know, that it should prioritize tiles that were already built and not overwrite it.
-   `force_rebuild` will force Valhalla to rebuild the tiles in all cases except for `force_rebuild_elevation`.
-   `force_rebuild_elevation` will always skip rebuilding the elevation data if `False`. That way downloading and processing huge amounts of elevation data can be omitted.
-   `build_*` will let Valhalla know what to build in detail. All of them are optional for a functioning Valhalla instance.

## 2. Run `docker-compose.yml`

Now let `docker-compose` build Valhalla by typing:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Docker will now pull the latest Valhalla image from [GIS • OPS Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/gisops/valhalla) and build it with the OSM files of Albania and Andorra. The image at Dockerhub is rebuilt every week from [Valhalla master](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla).

If you check the contents of your folder you will notice a new folder named `custom_files`. In there you'll find all the files Valhalla requires to properly run or rebuild any of its data. You can copy, compress, move the folder even to a different system and as long as you use the same `docker-compose.yml`, Valhalla will be able to immediately start with your data.

**Note**, the build time can be _more than 15 minutes_, depending on your hardware. Some parts of the build pipeline run multi-threaded to speed up the process. For error messages or warnings see the `Important Notes` section at the end of the tutorial.

## 3. Test Valhalla

### Check the Valhalla docker instance

After Valhalla has been built and started, it should be directly ready to be used. Let's try. First we're going to verify that Valhalla is running by typing:

```bash
docker ps -a
```   

This will give us an overview of the running docker containers:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE              COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                    NAMES
370161c6bea7   valhalla_valhalla  "/scripts/run.sh /co…"   9 seconds ago  Up 8 seconds  0.0.0.0:8002->8002/tcp   valhalla_valhalla_1
```   

-   `STATUS` tells us if the service runs successfully if it shows something like `Up x Seconds/Minutes/etc.`.
-   `PORTS` gives us the necessary information to connect to our container. In this case we can connect to Valhalla using the address `0.0.0.0` and the port `8002`.   

If your output includes Valhalla like the example, you're good to go to test Valhalla.

### Test Valhalla

Valhalla should be running correctly now, and we're going to test that with `curl` now:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8002/route --data '{"locations":[{"lat":41.318818,"lon":19.461336},{"lat":41.321001,"lon":19.459598}],"costing":"auto","directions_options":{"units":"miles"}}' | jq '.'
```

-   `curl` will call to the server running at the `localhost` with the port `8002`.
-   `--data` contains the request data for `curl`, in this case a JSON request `{"locations":...}` Valhalla expects
-   `jq '.'` will take the returned JSON response and print it nicely in the console.  
-   If you used another OSM extract replace the `lat` and `lon` variables from the curl command with ones inside your extract.


### Assess the response

The response of your Valhalla server should return something like the following JSON structure, depending on your OSM extract and the used coordinates:

<details><summary>Response JSON</summary>

          }
        ]
      }
    ],

        "type": "break"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```  
</p>
</details>
<br/>
In case you get a `response` looking like this:
```json
{
"error_code": 171,
"error": "No suitable edges near location",
"status_code": 400,
"status": "Bad Request"
}
```
It is most likely that you didn't change the coordinates for the `curl` request to ones that are inside your chosen OSM extract.
